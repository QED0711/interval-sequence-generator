## About

This project has helped form a major part of my work with Binary Harmony. 

the main focus of this project is to create sequences of pitches in pitch space, where each dyadic adjacency forms one interval from a given set of ordered pitch-class intervals. In doing this, you can map relationships within and among Pitch-Class sets.

Though the focus of this data in composition has primarily been with binary harmony, the algorithms in here can be used for ternary, quaternary, etc. harmony. 

## Installation
Fork and Clone this repository and run
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Notice

This project is still partially in development. If you are primarily interested in the algorithms used to generate the pitch sequences, see:

```
src/js/newGenerateFromSet.js
